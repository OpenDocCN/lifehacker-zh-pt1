### **疫苗猎人骗局如何运作**

由于许多州未能提供准确的疫苗预订信息， [疫苗猎人组织已经介入填补了](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/coronavirus/vaccine-hunters-share-advice-on-best-ways-to-find-a-shot/2588253/) 的空白。这些团体非正式地分享关于您可能在哪里获得预约的信息，无论是在县医疗保健网站、药房网站、非正式药房等候名单，还是在单个医院等候名单。本着善意的精神，这些团体中的人经常帮助陌生人(通常是老年人)代表他们预约疫苗接种。

不幸的是，这就是骗子们的切入点。骗子会伪装成好心人，询问你的个人信息，并试图出售虚假的疫苗预约或疫苗。 [商业改善局发布了一个警告](https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/23939-bbb-tip-hunting-for-a-covid-vaccine-be-careful-sharing-personal-info) 提醒人们警惕这个骗局，并提供了一些在寻找疫苗预约时避免欺诈的提示:

> *   **Always get vaccine appointments through official public health channels and approved suppliers.** In the United States, COVID-19 vaccine can only be obtained through official suppliers, such as local public health departments or pharmacies. The exact providers vary by region, but you can use [VaccineFinder.org] to find the list of your region. Aggregate websites should always point you to official providers to arrange your appointment.
> *   **Anyone who claims to sell vaccine doses is a scam. Beware of anyone who claims to have COVID-19 vaccine. This [report from the Digital Citizens Alliance](https://www.digitalcitizensalliance.org/clientuploads/directory/Reports/A_Shot_from_the_Darkest_Corner_of_the_Internet_Report.pdf) found the scam Facebook page advertises that China makes vaccines. Although these web pages did not actively promote the sales of drugs, the scammers offered to sell fake vaccines after contacting through Facebook Messenger.**
> *   **Don't spend money to add your name to the waiting list or get vaccinated.** **[BBB fraud tracker](https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker) has received a report that the swindler charged the fake vaccine reservation fee. The federal government is providing [vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html) free of charge to all people living in the United States. Vaccine suppliers can't charge you for vaccines. Any other statement is a hoax. Be very careful about revealing personal information. You don't need bank account information, credit card information or social security number when making vaccination appointment.**
> ***   **Be sure to check the URL carefully before entering personal information. Scammers often buy websites that look like official websites to commit fraud. Note that the link is really what it claims to be. If the email claims to be from the local government, please make sure the URL ends with. Gov (for the United States). In case of doubt, please conduct a separate internet search on this website or call its source directly.***   **Study** carefully. Liars are very creative, so be suspicious of anything that seems too good to be true. Carefully check any information about vaccines with official news sources.T45】**
